                Chalo Trust school is a <span style="color:#000"><strong>secondary and primary, boarding and day school</strong></span> with several programs on offer for children at different levels of education.
                
                At Chalo Trust School, we believe in the education of the whole child. We pride ourselves on an ability to produce well groomed, academically sound alumni who go on to acheive many things as productive members of society. <br><br>
                
                We plan detailed, daily lessons in all major subjects, and our lessons are designed to appeal to different learning styles. Our lessons are written to suit the current syllabus, using the best textbooks and workbooks available. Our program is proven and assures you no gaps in learning. In addition to our lessons, we support students with one on one teaching to students who may seem to be slow in learning and with our Placement Testing, Education Counselors, and Advisory Teaching Service, every student is steadily prepared to handle and pass their exams with confidence. <br><br>
                
                The school is affiliated to two examining Boards; The <span style="color:#000"><strong>Examinations Council of Zambia (ECZ)</strong></span> for the Primary Section (Baby Class-Grade 7) and for the Junior Secondary Section(Grade 8-9),  and <span style="color:#000"><strong>Cambridge International Examinations (CIE)</strong></span> for the Upper Secondary Section(Grade 10-12).

                The foundations of a rigorous, secondary education are built in primary school. Children begin to acquire knowledge and skills, amd they begin to develop neurologically-based skills for mental control and self-regulation as well as an awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. As pupils in reception and baby class, our youngest students learn what it means to be a part of a community. As fifth and sixth graders, they become leaders and role models for their peers. By the time students graduate primary school, they have found their voice and developed the confidence to use it. <br><br>

                At Chalo Trust School, our primary section utilizes the Zambian syllabus leading up to the Grade 7 National Examinations. We place emphasis on teaching our children the "Three Rs" - reading, writing and arithmetic. Pupils cover the Zambian Primary Course in its entirety, with emphasis on preparing children for a life on learning. <br><br>

                Our goal is to create an environment to challenge young minds, foster a commitment to learning, and, concurrently with academics, instill a moral framework so that students understand the concept of “us” as well as “me.” Well prepared for secondary school, students leave primary school confident and comfortable in their own skin with the skills they will need to succeed. <br><br>

                Our goal, in Junior Secondary, is to make sure each of our 8th and 9th graders leave our section wishing they could return. We accomplish this goal by building strong relationships with students and then leveraging those relationships to help students learn and become good citizens. When teachers care, students learn more. At CTS, we not only care about our students, but we make sure the students know that we are working with them, inside the classroom and out. <br><br>

                In grade 8 and 9, the aim of our curriculum is to introduce children to a wide range of subjects which serve the purpose of creating a foundation for a child's secondary school education. At this level, we offer the Zambian syllabus, with students writing the Junior Secondary School Leaving Examination. Students, who pass the examination, progress to Grade 10.<br><br> To qualify for the award of the JSSLE Certificate, a candidate must satisfy the minimum requirements of passes in six (6) subjects. For students who intend to write Zambian examinations at grade 12 level, The Certificate obtained at this level is a pre-requisite for eligibility to register for the examination. In other words, the JSSLE Certificate is a requirement for a candidate to undertake registration for Grade 12 Zambian examination.<br><br>
