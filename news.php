We give the Almighty God all the glory for what he enables us to do through his abundant grace.This term has been an irregular academic period in that, we opened and closed schools later than what we have been accustomed to. As you may be aware, Lusaka City and part of the nation were hit with a severe Cholera outbreak early this year.Public and private learning institutions were advised to keep closed during the heat of the pandemic, until at the reopening directive of the government.

                        Chalo Trust School will open schools on Monday 22nd January, 2018. Schools were initially slated to be opened on the 2nd of January, but a cholera outbreak meant that all schools in the country had to push back their intended opening dates. The Zambian government announced that schools would be allowed to re-open pending a health inspection. We underwent the inspection and the Ministry of Health has granted us authorization to open the school.
