        <h6>THE CURRICULUM</h6>
In grade 8 and 9, the aim of our curriculum is to introduce children to a wide range of subjects which serve the purpose of creating a foundation for a child's secondary school education. At this level, we offer the Zambian syllabus, with students writing the Junior Secondary School Leaving Examination. Students, who pass the examination, progress to Grade 10. To qualify for the award of the JSSLE Certificate, a candidate must satisfy the minimum requirements of passes in six (6) subjects. For students who intend to write Zambian examinations at grade 12 level, The Certificate obtained at this level is a pre-requisite for eligibility to register for the examination. In other words, the JSSLE Certificate is a requirement for a candidate to undertake registration for Grade 12 Zambian examination. The main objectives of the Lower Secondary Section are:
